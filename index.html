    <h1>Non-HTML, CSS, and JS code (A.K.A. server-side/backend code) will go here.</h1>
    <p>Main website: <a href="https://cerebraldatabank.neocities.org/">https://cerebraldatabank.neocities.org/</a></p>
    <p>Just found out GitHub only supports client-side code, paying or not. <a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a> is better. Without paying, you get the same benefits as GitHub, with paying at a very cheap rate, you get support for all file types.</p>
    <p><b>UPDATE (2019-03-28)</b>: Lol, this was so long ago &#x1F600; GitHub is a great service for source & version control. However, my main website will remain on Neocities.</p>
    <p><a class="gogo-btn gogo-blue-btn" href="https://cerebraldatabank.neocities.org/">Take me there!</a></p>
